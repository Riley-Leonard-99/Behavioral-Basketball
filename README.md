**Abstract:**

While the practice of data collection in professional sports existed at the inception of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the use of more advanced statistical analysis in player evaluation became ubiquitous only in recent years. Coaches, managers, and players are now aware of the advantages of utilizing empirical insights when facilitating in-game decisions—a discovery that has motivated dramatic changes in teams’ strategic approaches to the sport. Because we are concerned with the study of these in-game decisions, we thus turn to the field of behavioral economics. Employing a behavioral economic framework (in conjunction with the aforementioned statistical analysis) offers a unique understanding of the factors that determine individual decisions—specifically, player shooting decisions. The succeeding research analyzes these shooting decisions by assessing individual shot data in concert with a number of behavioral economic theories, including prospect theory and the hot hand fallacy. Through our analysis, we evince heterogeneity in expected utility with respect to different risk environments, as well as asymmetries in aggregate risk preferences based on game context.
